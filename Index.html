		   <p>The moon was alone one evening, shining in the midnight sky. Although she was surrounded by myriads of tiny,
			   sparkly stars, she felt as if there was no one to understand her. She eagerly searched the skies for a friend,
			   perhaps a meteor, with whom to discuss the joys and sorrows of her life. But there was nobody.</p>

<p>On the other side of the world, the sun yawned and awoke to shine his light upon the blue-green temples of God. He heard the call to worship,
	and saw the waves of people bowing and praying. He felt full of good will and charity towards the masses of God's servitors. Perhaps they 
	were not holy, but at least they were faithful.</p>

<p>Now the sun was unaware of her yearning, for he was too busy making the crops grow and warming the world. Those who wished his light had 
	only to look upward to heaven and he was there, beaming down upon them.</p>

<p>The moon continued to follow the sun, always coming nearer to him, always hearing that he had just left that portion of the sky, or was just over
	the next mountain range. Where before there was despair, now she was ever more hopeful, for she knew that she was approaching his presence.</p>

<p>She came closer and closer, until one glorious day came when she stood before him, naked and unafraid. The world looked up and saw only blackness 
	- in the middle of the day. But the moon stood mid-way between the sun and the earth, and all of his glory was for her.</p>

<p>His light blotted out all of her loneliness, all of her pain, all of her past. She stood bathed in wonder before him, and his light filled her soul.</p>

<p>Such is the soul of man, dear one. It yearns for the glorious light of Truth, which destroys all loneliness and memory. The many lives of man are as many
	times as the moon sees the sun - after each, nothing remains but a vague idea of a beauty once seen. And there is always the longing, and always the 
	return</p> </div>
